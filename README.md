# Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Computation
Course Description: Basic concepts in computing theory. Topics include recursive definitions, regular expressions, transition graphs, automata, nondeterminism, grammars, parsing, decidability, Turing machines

Course dedicated to more of the theory side of Computer Science. Part of this class was implementing programs that woudl convert problems of one type to another to prove that the starting problem is NP-complete.
For example, the conversion of a 3CNF to a clique. We also covered deteministic and non-deterministic machines and the steps one would take to create one. also covered certain discrete math
topics such as graphs as well as some regugular expressions.
